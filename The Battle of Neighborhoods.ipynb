    "#### **Idea**  \n",
    "I want to pick up suggestion 2. of our coursera tutor Alex Aklson. Let's suppose I am a business consultant and I have a new client who wants to open an Italian restaurant in Toronto. His name is Roberto and he is an Italian chef who worked for several well known restaurants and hotels everywhere in the world. Not long ago he had an engagement in Toronto, Canada. During this time he realized that most of the local Italian restaurants there only offer Pizza and Pasta. Born in Rome, Roberto knew that no one in Italy would call a Pizzeria a 'Ristorante'. If you step into a Restaurant in Italy and ask for a Pizza, he told me, you might really earn some unfriendly words. Genuine Italian food is much more than Pizza and has a very broad range of ingredients and flavours, differing from region to region. So Roberto had the idea to open his own original style Italian restaurant and serve all the fine meals of the regions between Milan and Sicily with monthly highlights of a special meal of one region like Ossobuco Milanese with Saffron Rice etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When planning his new engagement in Toronto, Roberto came to a point where he had to decide where to locate his restaurant in Toronto. As we have a long-term friendship he called me and asked me if I could help him finding the best place. Of course I assured him of my help and started this notebook to collect, process and analyze specific data and information about Toronto. In particular Foursqare migth help me, I thought, because it could provide specific venues data for the boroughs and neighborhoods of Toronto.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the best place and make a recommendation we have to take a close look at the available data and decide what  \n",
    "could be the best strategy, e.g.:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- are there already other Italian restaurants\n",
    "- could this be a chance because the people who go there seem to like Italian food\n",
    "- or could this be a problem due to the competitive situation\n",
    "- would it be better to choose a location whith e.g. more asian restaurants  to give the people an alternative\n",
    "- or might a higher no. of asian restaurants mean that the people there prefer asian food\n",
    "- would it be a good idea to look for alocation whith only few restaurants\n",
    "- or might there be reasons for the low no. of restaurants there\n",
    "- we can basically use the rating information of Foursqare to get a better juudgement of the situation\n",
    "- can we suppose a floating population due to some specificc venues nearby\n",
    "- etc. The data will give us a clearer view."
